Contributing Guidelines
=======================

This repository is for C++ developer tools, not libraries. To add a developer tool, create a new folder (preferably all lowercase without spaces in the name) and add the C++ source and header files (please use .cpp and/or .hpp extensions) as well as some way to compile and run the programs (we recommend a CMakeLists.txt). You must also include a README.md explaining how to use the tool and a LICENSE file describing the license for the tool.

When your pull request is accepted, add a page to the wiki for the new tool describing how it works and how to use it.
