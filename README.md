Dev Tools
=========

This repository is for C++ developer tools.

Contributing
------------

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

All new developer tools must be contained within their own folder.
The folder must contain a readme and a licence ( and hopefully some code ).
The code should be able to compile into an executable.
If it does not, please explain why in the readme.

A helpful readme includes:

* A description of the usage of the program.
* A method of compling the program ( ideally via command line ).
* A list of external libraries that the program requires
* The method in which you want others to contribute to your tool

If you do not know how to compile your code on the command line, please ask forhelp.

If you are unsure about what is expected, just make a pull request and we'll work it out.

Example
-------

Please see [png_splitter](https://github.com/cpluspluscom/dev-tools/tree/master/png_splitter)
as an example of how a tool should be released.
